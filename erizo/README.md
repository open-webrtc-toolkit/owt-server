# Erizo, a C/C++ Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Library for WebRTC 

Erizo is a project that aims to implement a library able to communicate with WebRTC (http://www.webrtc.org) browser clients in order to provide advanced communication services. Currently it is tested on Ubuntu 11.10 and above but it should be able to be compiled on other distributions.

Updated code documentation can be found at http://ging.github.com/erizo 

## Directory structure

- /src -  The root source directory
- /src/erizo - The source of the main library
- /src/examples - Examples and tests

## Requirements

- CMake >= 2.8 
- libSRTP version >= 1.4.4
- Libnice version >= 1.10
- boost_threads >= 1.48
- boost_regex >= 1.48 (optional, only for examples)
- boost_asio >= 1.48 (optional, only for examples)
- boost_system >= 1.48 (optional, only for examples)
 
## Building Instructions

This project is built using CMake.

The easiest way to build it is to use the provided scripts:
- Run ./generateProject.sh to run cmake, test the dependencies and generate the Makefile.
- Run ./buildProject.sh to build the project after generating the Makefile. It simply runs make in the build directory.
- Run ./generateEclipseProject.sh to generate an Eclipse CDT project which can be imported and used to work with the code.

If doxygen is availabe a "doc" target is generated. HTML documentation can be built by running "make doc" in the build directory.

##Examples

As of now, the only application built using the library is a streaming application that connects via TCP to a server application built on top of node.js.

The node.js app is not released but the code should provide an example on how the SDP exchange is made.
The examples are unusable as of now, but they can help to understand the API.
In the future, we will include here tests and updated examples.
