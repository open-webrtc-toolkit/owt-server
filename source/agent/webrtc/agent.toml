##Valid value is an array of objects that has two properties: name and replaced_ip_address. name is the name of network interface that will be used, replaced_ip_address is the IP address used for replacing the internal IP address in locally generated SDP's and ICE candidates during establishing the peer-connection(useful when behind NATs). replaced_ip_address is optional, if it is not specified, IP address from corresponding network interface will not be replaced.
#Example of valid value: [{name = "eth1"}, {name = "eth2", replaced_ip_address = "192.0.2.2"}].
