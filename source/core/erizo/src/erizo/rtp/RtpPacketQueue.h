// This class implements a packet reordering queue. Here's what it does:
//
// 1. Receives incoming packets and pushes them into a queue based on sequence number
// 2. Rejects duplicate packets--duplicate sequence numbers are dropped on the floor
// 3. Handles sequence number wrap (e.g. packet "1" is technically greater than "65535" because that
//    is a sequence number wrap
// 4. Handles out of order packets
// 5. Handles late packets.  Packets with sequence number greater than the last sequence number
//    handed out through popPacket are discarded.  There's a log message to help identify
//    a sane value for their queue depth.
// 6. Is threadsafe.  All public methods lock to ensure the container isn't fouled by multithreaded
//    access.  This also prevents a minimal amount of locking in calling classes, which prevents
//    blocking of worker threads.
// 7. Manages queue depth.  It won't return data until depth (which is % of seconds) is attained, and
//    will prevent the queue from growing over max seconds.
//
// Usage is straight-forward:
//
// 1. instantiate and push incoming data with pushPacket().
// 2. check if data is ready to be popped by calling hasData().
// 3. pop data with popPacket().  popPacket returns a null shared_ptr if nothing is available.
// 4. popPacket() can be called with an override to drain the queue regardless of the current depth.
