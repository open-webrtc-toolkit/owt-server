    // Timestamping strategy: we use the RTP timestamps so we don't have to restamp and we're not
    // subject to error due to the RTP packet queue depth and playout.
    //
    // However, the units of our audio and video RTP timestamps are not comparable because:
    //
    // 1. RTP timestamps start at a random value
    // 2. The units are completely different.  Video is typically on a 90khz clock, whereas audio
    //    typically follows whatever the sample rate is (e.g. 8khz for PCMU, 48khz for Opus, etc.)
    //
    // So, our strategy is to keep track of the first audio and video timestamps we encounter so we
    // can adjust subsequent timestamps by that much so our timestamps roughly start at zero.
    //
    // Audio and video can also start at different times, and it's possible video wouldn't even arrive
    // at all (or arrive late) so we also need to keep track of a start time offset.  We also need to track
    // this *before* stuff enters the RTP packet queue, since that guy will mess with the timing of stuff that's
    // outputted in an attempt to re-order incoming packets.  So when we receive an audio or video packet,

    // and that value is added to every timestamp we write.
