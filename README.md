## Open WebRTC Toolkit Media Server

The media server for OWT provides an efficient video conference and streaming service that is based on WebRTC. It scales a single WebRTC stream out to many endpoints. At the same time, it enables media analytics capabilities for media streams. It features:

- Distributed, scalable, and reliable SFU + MCU server
- High performance VP8, VP9, H.264, and HEVC real-time transcoding on Intel® Core™ and Intel® Xeon® processors
- Wide streaming protocols support including WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, HLS, MPEG-DASH
- Efficient mixing of HD video streams to save bandwidth and power on mobile devices
- Intelligent Quality of Service (QoS) control mechanisms that adapt to different network environments
- Customer defined media analytics plugins to perform analytics on streams from MCU
- The usage scenarios for real-time media stream analytics including but not limited to movement/object detection

## How to install develop dependency

In the repository root, use one of following commands to install dependency.
- Interactive mode: `scripts/installDeps.sh`
- Non-interactive mode: `scripts/installDepsUnattended.sh`
In interactive mode, you need type "yes" to continue installation several times and in non-interactive, the installation continues automatically.

## How to build release package

### Requirements
The media server can be built on following platforms:
1. Ubuntu 18.04
2. CentOS 7.6

### Instructions
In the root of the repository:
1. Build native components: `scripts/build.js -t all --check`.
2. Pack built components and js files: `scripts/pack.js -t all --install-module --sample-path ${webrtc-javascript-sdk-sample-conference-dist}`.

The ${webrtc-javascript-sdk-sample-conference-dist} is built from owt-javascript-sdk, e.g. `~/owt-client-javascript/dist/sample/conference`, see https://github.com/open-webrtc-toolkit/owt-client-javascript for details.

If "--archive ${name}" option is appended to the pack command, a "Release-${name}.tgz" file will be generated in root folder. For other options, run the scripts with "--help" option.

## Quic Start
In the repository root, run following commands to start media server on single machine:
1. `./bin/init-all.sh --deps`
2. `./bin/start-all.sh`
3. Open https://localhost:3004 to visit the web sample page. Due to the test certificate, you may need confirm this unsafe access.
