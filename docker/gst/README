1. How to build Open Web Toolkit(OWT) image
Please download openvino version 2019.3.334 from https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download and place it in docker/gst folder
Run ./build_docker_image.sh then following 3 docker images for OWT will be generated:
 gst-owt:build -- OWT build environment image, used to compile and generate OWT package
 gst-owt:run -- OWT main modules run environment image, used to run all OWT modules except analytics agent
 gst-analytics:run -- OWT analytics run environment image, used to run Gstreamer pipeline based OWT analytics agent

2. How to deploy OWT
 a. OWT run on serverip
 	Launch OWT main modules image(gst-owt:run) with following command:
 	docker run -itd --net=host gst-owt:run bash
 	then log into docker container and run following command:
 	cd /home
 	./start.sh
 	Then all OWT modules except analytics agent will be launched. To stop analytics agent run following command:
 	cd /home/owt
 	./bin/stop-all.sh

b. Start analytics agent container
	Copy analytics agent image(gst-analytics:run) and related models to device and load the image, launch a container with following command:

	 docker run -u root -v ~:/mnt -v /var/tmp:/var/tmp --privileged --net=host $(env | grep -E '_(proxy)=' | sed 's/^/-e /') --entrypoint bash -tid gst-analytics:run

	then log into docker container and modify rabbitmq host configuration in /home/analytics_agent/agent.toml:

	[agent]
	#Max processes that agent can run
	maxProcesses = 50 #default: 13

	If analytics and owt container are running on the same device, just leave below rabbit host to localhost, otherwise, set analytics rabbit host to rabbitmq server address (We will start rabbitmq server by default in OWT container, so in most cases please set this rabbit.host to OWT server address)
	[rabbit]
	host = "172.32.1.254" #default: "localhost"
	make sure that models can be found in analytics agent container. Follow steps below to download OpenVINO pre-trained models:
        1) Download source code package in  https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/releases/tag/2019_R3.1
        2) Follow open_model_zoo-2019_R3.1/tools/downloader/README.md to download OpenVINO pre-trained models.
        you can configure related model parameters in /home/analytics_agent/plugin.cfg
c. Compile pipeline share library
	Follow README in /home/analytics_agent/plugins on analytics container to compile pipeline share library, you can follow the README to build your own GStreamer pipeline.

If analytics agent is deployed on VCAA card and VPU is used(in detect_pipeline in analytics_agent/plugins/samples), launch hddldaemon VCAA card  before running analytics agent on container.


Then launch analytics agent with following command in /home:
./bin/daemon.sh start analytics-agent


Then you can open chrome tab and go to url: https://serverip:3004 and start your analytics with specified stream.
