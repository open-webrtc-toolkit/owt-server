Description: Generic library for real-time communications with async IO support
 Libre is a portable and generic library for real-time communications
 with async IO support and a complete SIP stack with support for protocols
 such as SDP, RTP/RTCP, STUN/TURN/ICE, BFCP, HTTP and DNS Client.
 .
 The current features are:
 .
  SIP Stack (RFC 3261)
  SDP parser
  RTP and RTCP stack
  DNS-Client
  STUN/TURN/ICE stack
  BFCP
  Jitter-buffer
  Async I/O (poll, epoll, select)
  UDP/TCP/TLS/DTLS transport
  HTTP Client and Server
  Websocket Client and Server
  JSON parser
  SRTP and SRTCP (Secure RTP)
 .
 Design goals:
 .
  Portable POSIX source code (ANSI C89 and ISO C99 standard)
  Robust, fast, low memory footprint
  RFC compliance
  IPv4 and IPv6 support
